As a the Offshore Wind and Blue Economy Fellow at the Coastal Resources Center, I am involved in the marine policy world surrounding offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, coastal management, and more, working specifically on communication initiatives and project implementation. **I am passionate about responsible, equitable access to our oceans and sustainable management practices of our planet's resources, and I'm thankful to have a job where these passions can be blended together and valued in the workplace.**

I'm also studying at the University of Rhode Island to obtain my Master's Degree in Environmental Science and Management with a focus on Environmental Policy. On top of my degree, I am working to obtain a certification in GIS and Remote Sensing and another certification in Science Writing and Rhetoric. I plan to graduate in May of 2022.
